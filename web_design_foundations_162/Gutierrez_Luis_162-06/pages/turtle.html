					<p>
						Although it’s not too widely known, we have sea turtles here in San Diego. Southern California represents
						the northernmost limit for resident East Pacific green turtles, a subpopulation of the pan-tropical green turtle.
						These hard-shelled air-breathing reptiles, named for their green body fat, have beautiful carapaces (shells),
						especially when they are younger. They generally eat aquatic vegetation like eelgrass but may consume invertebrates as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						One population lives in south San Diego Bay near the now-decommissioned South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista.
						This annual grouping of about 40 to 90 turtles spends time in the bay foraging on eelgrass and invertebrates,
						and lounging about — especially during the winter when the water in the bay is warmer than the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sea turtles make long-distance migrations from nesting beaches to foraging grounds and San Diego's green turtles are no exception.
						In the spring, some of the adults head for nesting grounds in Michoacan and the Revillagigedo Islands in Mexico, returning in the fall.
